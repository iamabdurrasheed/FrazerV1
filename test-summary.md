# Cart Implementation Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. ✅ Removed Free Shipping Information from Cart Page
- Removed the following items from `/src/app/cart/page.tsx`:
  - ✓ Free shipping on all orders
  - ✓ 30-day return policy  
  - ✓ Secure payment processing

### 2. ✅ Updated Navigation Cart Button
- Changed cart button in navigation from opening sidebar to linking directly to cart page
- Updated both desktop and mobile cart buttons
- Replaced bag icon with shopping trolley icon
- Added item count badge to both desktop and mobile versions
- Cart button now uses `Link` component instead of `button` with `onClick`

### 3. ✅ Modified Cart Context Behavior
- Added route awareness using `usePathname()` from Next.js
- Cart sidebar automatically closes when navigating to `/cart` page
- `openCart()` function now prevents opening sidebar when already on cart page
- Ensures "either sidebar OR cart page" behavior as requested

### 4. ✅ Cart Sidebar Functionality Preserved
- Cart sidebar still works from other pages (like product pages)
- Maintains all existing functionality for quantity updates, item removal, etc.
